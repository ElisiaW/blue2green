Not all algal blooms are harmful, as an abundance of algae would result in a large food supply for the organisms in that environment. They are harmful, however, when they cause hypoxia or when they become toxic.</p><p><em>Hypoxia</em> occurs when there is a depletion of oxygen in a marine environment. This is most likely a result of <em>eutrophication</em>, which is when there is an overabundance of nutrients present in the water, which then leads to an increased growth of algae. This is usually caused by runoff related to agricultural practices, as phosphorus pollution leads to an increased algae growth in waters.</p><p>Hypoxia can lead to the creation of a <em>dead zone</em>, as having little to no oxygen would result in the death of marine life. Toxins produced by harmful algal blooms have deeply affected the economy and health of the environment, as well as the public. Coastal towns and cities that rely on tourism are negatively affected by toxic algal blooms. People that live in those areas are vulnerable to illnesses caused by the toxins that are produced, which some can even be fatal. It is also detrimental to the environment, as these toxins also can result in the death of marine life, and severely impact an aquatic ecosystem.</p></div><nav aria-label="Adjacent Posts"><ul><li> <a href="/blog/the-most-recent-post-so-far" rel="prev">&laquo; Growing out of Control</a></li></ul></nav></main><footer> <small>This project is maintained by <a href="https://www.danurbanowicz.com" rel="noopener">Dan Urbanowicz</a>.
